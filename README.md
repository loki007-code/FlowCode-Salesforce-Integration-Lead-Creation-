Documentation: Flowcode + Salesforce Integration (Lead creation)
________________________________________
1. Introduction to Flowcode
Flowcode is a next-generation QR code platform designed for businesses and creators. Unlike traditional static QR codes, Flowcode offers dynamic, trackable, and customizable QR codes that can be linked to websites, forms, CRM systems, or digital experiences.

2. How Flowcode Works
1.	QR Code Generation
o	Businesses create QR codes in Flowcode and customize them (colors, logos, branding).
o	Each QR code links to a destination URL (e.g., form, landing page, payment gateway, CRM portal).
2.	Scanning & Redirect
o	Customers scan the QR code using their mobile device.
o	Flowcode routes them to the defined destination.
3.	Data Capture & Analytics
o	Every scan is tracked: time, device, location, frequency.
o	Flowcode dashboards show engagement data.
4.	CRM Integration
o	Flowcode can integrate directly with CRM systems like Salesforce to capture leads, customer activity, or marketing campaign data.

3. Advantages of Flowcode
Dynamic Codes – destinations can be updated anytime without reprinting.
Custom Branding – QR codes with colors, logos, and shapes.
Analytics – scan tracking, location, and engagement.
CRM-Friendly – direct integrations with Salesforce, HubSpot, and others.
Security & Privacy – encrypted scan data, unlike most free QR tools.

4. Disadvantages of Flowcode
Paid Model – advanced features (dynamic links, analytics, CRM integration) require subscription.
Dependency – business depends on Flowcode’s servers; if they go down, QR codes break.
Not Fully Native – in Salesforce use cases, Flowcode acts only as the gateway, not the CRM itself.

5. How Flowcode is Different from Other QR Platforms
•	Static Generators (like free QR websites) only embed one fixed link, no analytics.
•	Flowcode offers:
o	Dynamic redirection
o	Real-time analytics
o	Custom branding
o	Secure CRM integrations
•	Competitors like Bitly QR, Beaconstac, QR Code Monkey offer similar services, but Flowcode is more CRM-focused and brand-driven.

6. CRM Use Cases of QR Codes
•	Lead Generation – QR links to a lead form, captures customer details directly into Salesforce.
•	Customer Engagement – QR on products to drive loyalty registrations.
•	Event Management – QR for check-ins or RSVP that creates Salesforce records.
•	Payments/Donations – QR connected to Salesforce records for transaction tracking.

7. Technical Documentation – QR Code Lead Capture with Salesforce Experience Site
7.1. Introduction
This document explains how QR code technology was integrated with Salesforce Experience Cloud (Community Site) to streamline lead capture. Users scan a QR code, open a web form hosted inside the community site, submit their details, and the information is stored in Salesforce as a Lead record via Apex.
________________________________________
7.2. What is Flowcode? (Summary from earlier)
•	Flowcode is a dynamic QR code generation platform that connects offline interactions to digital workflows.
________________________________________
7.3. How QR Code Was Embedded with Salesforce
Step 1: Generate QR Code
•	A QR code was generated via Flowcode.
•	The QR code contains the public Experience Site URL of the Salesforce community page hosting our lead capture form.
Step 2: Embed URL Inside QR Code
•	Example:
•	https://mycompany.force.com/leadform/s/
•	When scanned, users are redirected to the above community page.
________________________________________
7.4. Community Site Setup
•	Enabled Digital Experiences → Created a new Experience Site (community).
•	Configured Guest User Profile for the community to ensure public users can access:
o	The LeadFormController Apex class
o	The custom LWC component
o	Necessary object/field permissions for Lead creation.
o	To give permissions create permission set – and assign it to guest user (on search bar search using site name + guest user and assign it).
________________________________________
7.5. Lightning Web Component (LWC)
Component Purpose
•	Display a lead capture form (First Name, Last Name, Company, Email, Phone).
•	On submit, call an Apex method to insert a Lead record.
Placement
•	The LWC (leadForm) was deployed and placed into a Community Site page using Lightning App Builder.
________________________________________
7.6. Apex Controller
•	Created an Apex class (LeadFormController) to handle record creation.
•	Method exposed with @AuraEnabled for LWC → Apex communication.
•	Security handled by giving Guest User access to the class and Lead fields.
________________________________________
7.7. Workflow of the Project
1.	User scans QR code
o	Opens the Experience Site public URL.
2.	LWC Form loads in Community page
o	User enters details like name, company, email, phone.
3.	Form submission triggers Apex
o	LWC → Apex → Insert Lead record.
4.	Lead saved in Salesforce CRM
o	Record is available for Sales teams to follow up.

7.8. CRM Benefits
•	Eliminates manual lead entry at events, booths, or offline marketing campaigns.
•	Seamless integration between offline QR interactions and Salesforce CRM.
•	Centralized lead database accessible to sales and marketing teams.

7.9. Advantages of This Implementation
•	Scalable – QR code can be placed on flyers, events, or digital channels.
•	Future-proof – If the site changes, QR code can be updated with new URL.
•	Native Salesforce – Used LWC + Apex, no dependency on external web servers.
•	Secure – Guest user permissions limited only to required objects and fields.
